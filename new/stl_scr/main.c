/*
======== Intro / Overview ========
After Michael Schwarz made some interesting observations, we started
looking into variants other than the three already-known ones.

I noticed that Intel's Optimization Manual says in
section 2.4.4.5 ("Memory Disambiguation"):

    A load instruction micro-op may depend on a preceding store. Many
    microarchitectures block loads until all preceding store address
    are known.
    The memory disambiguator predicts which loads will not depend on
    any previous stores. When the disambiguator predicts that a load
    does not have such a dependency, the load takes its data from the
    L1 data cache.
    Eventually, the prediction is verified. If an actual conflict is
    detected, the load and all succeeding instructions are re-executed.

According to my experiments, this effect can be used to cause
speculative execution to continue far enough to execute a
Spectre-style gadget on a pointer read from a memory slot to which a
store has been speculatively ignored. I have tested this behavior on
the following processors from Intel and AMD:

 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz [Skylake laptop]
 - AMD PRO A8-9600 R7, 10 COMPUTE CORES 4C+6G [AMD desktop]
 - Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 @ 3.50GHz [Haswell desktop]

I haven't yet tested this on any ARM CPU.

Interestingly, only on the Skylake laptop, it seems to work when
interrupts and SMP are disabled while the test is running; on the
other machines, it seems to only work when interrupts are enabled,
maybe because the kernel code cause some noise that garbles some
predictor state or so? Or just because they mess up timing
somewhere...


There were mentions of data speculation on the netdev list, in a
somewhat different context:

https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg212262.html
https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg215369.html

However, I'm not entirely sure about the terminology. Do
"data speculation" and "value speculation" include speculating about
the *source* of data, or do they refer exclusively to directly
speculating about the *value* of data?





======== Demo code (no privilege boundaries crossed) ========
This is some code that purely demonstrates the basic effect and shows
that it is possible to combine it with a Meltdown/Spectre-style
gadget for leaking data into the cache. It does not cross any
privilege boundaries.
