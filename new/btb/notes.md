the variation of the attack is sa-ip.

since branch predictors are indexed by thread in gem5, a cross-address space attack will require some work to do.

i'm unsure about out-of-place training, the transient.fail example is extremely cumbersome so i never was able to finish it. the same reverse-engineering of hashing done for the above will probably be helpful in implementing out-of-place training.
